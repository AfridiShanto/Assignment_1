            <div>
                <p align="justify"><b>Engin Altan Düzyatan</b> (Turkish pronunciation: [æɲˈɟin aɫˈtan dyzjaˈtan]; born
                    26 July 1979) is a Turkish film and television actor. Born in Karşıyaka, İzmir Province, Turkey,
                    Düzyatan studied theatre at the Dokuz Eylül University in his home province before making his acting
                    debut with Ruhsar (2001). He then went on to act in various roles in film and television in Turkey.
                    Düzyatan rose to international prominence for his role as <strong><em>Ertuğrul Bey in Diriliş:
                            Ertuğrul.</em></strong>

                    On 28 August 2014, he married the granddaughter of Selim Soydan and Hülya Koçyiğit, Neslişah
                    Alkoçlar.The couple has a son, Emir Aras (born 2016) and a daughter, Alara (born 2018). In 2020,
                    Düzyatan went on a short visit to Pakistan, where Diriliş: Ertuğrul has gained popularity, accepting
                    the invitation of a private business company. Pakistan's Make-A-Wish Foundation arranged a meeting
                    between Düzyatan and three young terminally ill fans; when there, Engin said, "Thank you very much,
                    I can see I inspired you and I am very happy for this love." After signing an agreement with the
                    Lahore-based Chaudhary Group of Companies, of which he was a brand ambassador, he visited Lahore and
                    became one of the top discussions on social media and one of his pictures with a lion went viral. He
                    was treated with "a flood of love" while the Pakistani army had to protect him to avoid a stampede
                    of people coming up to him. Düzyatan returned to Turkey after being defrauded by Pakistani TikTok
                    star Kashif Zameer. Despite this incident, Kashif Zameer claimed that Düzyatan would return to
                    Pakistan, with a clip of his "pleasant memories" going viral. Düzyatan also wishes to appear in a
                    Pakistani drama series one day, "if it has a good story."
